//! trusty-mpm daemon library.
//!
//! Why: the daemon's HTTP API and shared state are useful beyond the `trusty-mpmd`
//! binary — sibling crates (e.g. the Telegram bot's test suite) reuse the real
//! `api::router` and `DaemonState` to drive in-process integration tests without
//! a live daemon. Exposing the modules as a library makes that possible.
//! What: re-exports the daemon's modules as `pub` so both `main.rs` and external
//! consumers can build against them.
//! Test: the modules carry their own `#[cfg(test)]` suites; `cargo test
//! -p trusty-mpm-daemon` exercises them.
